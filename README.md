# Mushroom-Exploration-with-ML-Models
Comparative Analysis of ML Models (KNN, SVM, Linear Regression) on Mushroom Dataset

Project Description:
Mushroom Dataset Exploration: Leveraging KNN, SVM, and Linear Models" is a machine learning project aimed at exploring and analyzing the Mushroom Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains descriptive information about various mushroom species, including physical characteristics such as shape, color, surface texture, and odor. The goal is to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous.

The project implements multiple machine learning approaches for classification, focusing on the following models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), which classifies samples based on their proximity to nearest neighbors; Support Vector Machine (SVM), which separates classes using a hyperplane with maximum margin; and Linear Regression, which serves as a baseline model for performance comparison.

Key features of the project include data preprocessing, which involves handling categorical variables, addressing missing values, and normalizing data; data exploration, which utilizes visualizations to understand data distributions and uncover patterns; model benchmarking, which compares the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of each model; and model evaluation, which analyzes performance using a confusion matrix and classification report.

This project was developed during my association with Cyber Academy at the Cyber-Physical Systems Lab, showcasing the integration of practical machine learning techniques with domain expertise. It demonstrates how mushroom characteristics can be effectively used for classification while comparing the strengths and weaknesses of commonly used machine learning algorithms.
