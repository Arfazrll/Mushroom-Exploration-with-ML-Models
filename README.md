# üçÑ Mushroom Exploration with ML Models

**Comparative Analysis of ML Models (KNN, SVM, Linear Regression) on Mushroom Dataset**

---

## Project Description

**Mushroom Dataset Exploration: Leveraging KNN, SVM, and Linear Models** is a machine learning project aimed at exploring and analyzing the **Mushroom Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom). This dataset contains descriptive information about various mushroom species, including physical characteristics such as shape, color, surface texture, and odor. The goal is to classify mushrooms as either **edible** or **poisonous**.

This project implements multiple machine learning approaches for classification, focusing on the following models:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies samples based on their proximity to nearest neighbors.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Separates classes using a hyperplane with maximum margin.
- **Linear Regression**: Serves as a baseline model for performance comparison.
